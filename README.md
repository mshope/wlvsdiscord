# WLVS Discord Bot #
Discord Bot for Wolvesatmydoor. Built off of [Discord.Js](https://discord.js.org/).
## Getting Started ##
To contribute, please make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well as a text editor (I recommend [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
You will also need [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control.

Once you have the the project downloaded navigate to the directory in bash and execute the following command:

```
npm install
```
This will install the needed node dependencies.

Please branch contributions off master and submit a PR to merge in, let's try to keep a clean master if we can :). 

If there is enough interest in this we can start a slack channel and go through changes. Let me know if you want to invite anyone or if you have any questions!
